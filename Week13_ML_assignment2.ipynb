    "# Consequences: The model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data (testing or validation data). It lacks generalization, making it unreliable for real-world predictions.\n",

It occurs when the model is not sufficiently complex to learn the relationships and nuances present in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training data and unseen data. In essence, an underfit model exhibits high bias and low variance.\n",

    "# Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and how do they affect model performance?\n",
    "# ANS The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the relationship between two types of errors a model can make: bias and variance.\n",
    "# Bias: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem (which may be complex) by a simplified model. A high bias indicates that the model makes strong assumptions about the data, leading it to systematically underfit the training data.\n",
    "# Effect on Model: A model with high bias is too simplistic and often fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both the training data and unseen data, resulting in low accuracy.\n",
    "# Variance: Variance refers to the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. A high variance indicates that the model is highly flexible and can fit the training data very closely.\n",
    "# Effect on Model: A model with high variance tends to overfit the training data by capturing noise and random fluctuations. While it may perform exceptionally well on the training data, it generalizes poorly to unseen data, leading to poor performance in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "# The relationship between bias and variance can be summarized as follows:As you decrease bias (e.g., by using more complex models), you typically increase variance.As you increase bias (e.g., by using simpler models), you typically decrease variance."

    "# ANS 1. Visual Inspection of Learning Curves:Overfitting: In the learning curve, you'll observe that the training error is significantly lower than the validation (or test) error. The gap between the two curves widens as the model becomes more complex.\n",
    "# Underfitting: In this case, both the training and validation errors are high, and they converge at a suboptimal performance level.\n",

    "# 3. Regularization Techniques:If you're using regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization, examine the effect of regularization strength (e.g., regularization parameter, alpha) on the model's performance. Overfitting is often indicated by a significant performance drop when regularization is reduced.\n",
    "# 4. Monitoring Validation Loss:During model training, keep track of the validation loss or error. If the validation loss starts increasing while the training loss continues to decrease, this is a sign of overfitting.\n",
    "# 5. Inspecting Feature Importance:In some cases, you can analyze feature importance scores generated by the model. If a few features have extremely high importance scores while others are neglected, it could be a sign of overfitting."
