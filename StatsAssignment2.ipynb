Then calculate the squared differences of each value from the mean: (15 - 18.14)^2, (18 - 18.14)^2, and so on. Sum up these squared differences and divide by the total number of values to get the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard Deviation:The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It's a more intuitive measure of dispersion since it's in the same units as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability.\n",
    "# Example:Using the variance example, once you've calculated the variance, take the square root to get the standard deviation. This gives a value that represents the average distance between data points and the mean in the original units (degrees Celsius in this case)."
