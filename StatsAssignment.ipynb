Descriptive statistics are primarily concerned with providing a concise overview of the data.\n",

    "# ANS \n",
    "# Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1) Mean: The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the total number of values. It represents the balance point of the dataset.\n",
    "# Use: The mean provides a common reference point for the dataset.It can be sensitive to outliers, which might skew the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it's arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The median is resistant to outliers and extreme values, making it a better choice when the data is skewed or contains outliers. It provides a measure of central tendency that's not affected by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have no mode (no value appears more than once), one mode, or multiple modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The mode is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data. It helps identify the most common value, which might be important in certain contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The range provides a quick sense of the spread in the dataset. However, it's sensitive to outliers and doesn't give information about the distribution of values between the extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared difference between each data point and the mean of the dataset. It quantifies how much the data points deviate from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Variance provides a comprehensive measure of the dispersion in the dataset. However, its units are squared, making it less intuitive to interpret. The square root of the variance is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It's a measure of how much the data values deviate from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Standard deviation is widely used to describe the spread or dispersion of data. It's often preferred over variance because its units are the same as the original data, making it easier to interpret."
