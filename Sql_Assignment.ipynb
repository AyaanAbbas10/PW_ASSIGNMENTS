    "#### SQL-1)SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.\n",
    "2)\tSQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.\n",
    "3)\tSQL databases are vertically scalable.\n",
    "#### NOSQL-1)NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.\n",
    "#### 2)NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.\n",
