It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user. \n",

    "## 2) Users can get their apps up and running faster with APIs performing communication functions.\n",
    "## DISADVANTAGES OF API\n",
    "## 1) Developing and implementing API is costly at times and requires high maintenance and support from developers.\n",
    "## 2) Using API adds another layer of surface which is then prone to attacks, and hence the security risk problem is common in APIs."

    "## API\n",
    "## 1)APIs are application interfaces, implying that one application can communicate with another application in a standardized manner.\n",
